# CASE STUDY: CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE ANALYS        ![Screenshot 2023-07-05 191359](https://github.com/VShethe/Google-Data-Analytics-Capstone-Complete-a-Case-Study/assets/128286364/ee96a5e1-650c-4acd-a93f-d71f95d4b740)

In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will work for a fictional 
company, Cyclistic, and meet different characters and team members. The data is taken from a real 
company DIVVY Bicycle sharing system which is a proxy for Cyclistic Data.

## Summary of the Project


1. The Member riders make up 60% and casual riders make of 40% of the total riders. Summer-Spring months from May to September the ridership is at its peak with July being the month with the most ridership by member and casual riders. Autumn - Winter months have the lowest ridership, majority of which is by the member riders.

2. During the weekdays members make 64% and casual riders make 36% of the ridership. On weekends the ridership of both casuals and member riders is quite equal making 50% each on Saturdays and Sundays, Saturday being the  day with ridership at its peak.

3. Members and casual riders both preferred electric_bike following by classic_bike, docked_bike were only used by 
casual riders. Although electric_bike being more popular, the ride time of classic_bike of both the riders far exceed 
electric_bike. This might be due to the difference in the price range of both the bikes, classic bikes price being cheaper 
than electric bikes

4. On an average Casual riders were making longer rides than members. In autumn-winter months of October to February the difference in ride duration between members and casual riders is lower than as compared to the ride duration in spring-summer months where casual rider's duration far exceeds the members. The longest rides have been made from April to July. The shortest rides have been made in December and January. On weekends the ride duration is higher for casual riders and on weekdays the ride duration is higher for member riders

5. There is an anomaly seen with the ride duration of docked bikes. The bikes are mostly used by casual riders have a duration that far exceeds the lime of 24 hours. This might be due to the casual riders not clocking out the ride time correctly or the bike being stolen.

6. The most common time that the bikes will be used by both the members and casual is 5pm in the evening, with summer months having the most ridership at 5 pm and winter months the least.

The riders' activity over a year, week, and day, as well as their differing behaviour patterns on weekdays and weekends, may 
be explained by the rides' aims. Both casual riders and members appear to utilise their motorcycles for leisure on weekends, 
which may explain why we see similar ridership by members and casual riders on weekends. Summer months have an 
overabundance of casual bikers. Members appear to utilise bikes for work purposes more frequently, which explains their 
high activity during the weekdays and throughout the autumn-winter months.



## The phases of the data analysis lifecycle (Roadmap)


1. ASK
   
    Key tasks:
    - Identify the business task 
    - Consider key stakeholders

    CHARACTERS AND TEAMS:
    - Customer
    - Interested Parties: Stakeholders, Cyclistic marketing      analytics team
    SENARIO
    - You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclitic. 
    - The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships
    - Understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently.
    - From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members.
    - Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

    CYCLISTIC BIKE-SHARE:
    - About the Company:

      In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.Cyclisticâ€™s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments.One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: 

       â€¢ single-ride passes

       â€¢ full-day passes

       â€¢ Annual memberships - also referred to as Cyclistic Membe

2. PREPARE

    Key tasks 
    - Download data and store it appropriately. 
    - Identify how itâ€™s organized. 
    - Sort and filter the data.
    - Determine the credibility of the data.

    DATA SOURCE
    
     Download the previous 12 months of Cyclistic trip data. (Note: The datasets have a different name because Cyclistic is a fictional company. For the purposes of this case study, the datasets are appropriate and will enable you to answer the business questions. The data has been made available by Motivate International Inc. under this license.) 

     This is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bikes.

3. PROCESS

    Key tasks
    - Check the data for errors.
    - Choose your tools.
    - Transform the data so you can work with it effectively.
    - Document the cleaning process.

4. ANALYZE

    Key tasks
    - Aggregate your data so itâ€™s useful and accessible.
    - Organize and format your data.
    - Perform calculations.
    - Identify trends and relationships.


    ANALYZING DATA WITH SPREADSHEET
    - Analyzing data with excel spreadsheet and power Query
    
    ANALYZING THE DATA: POWER QUERY, PIVOT TABLES AND TABLEAU (FOR GRAPHS) FOR : HOW DO ANNUAL MEMBERS AND CASUAL RIDERS USE CYCLISTIC BIKES DIFFERENTLY?

    - Membership Type
    - Types of bikes and types of users
    - Number of Rideable Bike types (Monthly)
    - Number of riders and the average ride length (Monthly)
    - Number of riders and the average ride length (Weekly)
    - Comparison between Member and Casual riders behaviours
    -  Comparison of average time on electric and classic on yearly and weekly basis
    -  Abnormalities in docked_bike average and max ride time   
    - Most common ride start time

5. SHARE AND ACT

The objectives of the analysis discussed above are to inform the stakeholders of the insights and results and to provide advice 
for the business that can assist in accomplishing the assignment that Moreno has given : How are Cyclistic bikes used 
differently by yearly members and casual riders? All the data gathered through analysis with Spreadsheet, Power Query, and Tableau is visualised in the Document.
